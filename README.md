# Cars Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project involves conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about cars. The dataset provides key information such as the car's make, type, origin (Asia, Europe, USA), profit, model, number of cylinders, horsepower, and invoice columns.

## Project Goals
The primary goals of this project are:
- To gain insights into the characteristics and attributes of the cars in the dataset.
- To visualize and explore relationships between various car features.
- To assess the profitability of different car models and origins.

## Tools Used
- Python for data analysis and visualization.
- Power BI for additional visualizations.

## Key Findings
- A summary of the key findings and insights obtained from the analysis.

## Files Included
- **Cars.ipynb**: Python Jupyter notebook containing the EDA code.
- **CarsData.csv**: The dataset used for the analysis.
- **Power BI Dashboard of cars dataset.JPG**: A ScreenShot of Power BI visualizations.
- **car.pbix**: A Power BI file with additional visualizations.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook, `Cars.ipynb`, to view the code and analysis.
3. Use Power BI to explore the additional visualizations in `Cars.pbix`.

## Requirements
- Python (with required libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI (optional, for additional visualizations)

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project can be found in the `CarsData.csv` file.
